While plain text is a sufficient medium for communicating with users (whether
they be other programmers, or end-users), it lacks a versatile way of marking
up parts of the text in a way that could be rendered in different ways as
markdown, HTML or console text: usually, it's necessary to commit early to
the output format. _Fulminate_ fills this gap by providing a convenient
representation of a message, with constructors which automatically contrast
the dynamic parts of the message from the static parts.
